Welcome to ____ (fill in name).

Currently in the United States, shootings are running rampant, endangering the innocent lives of those that live in those areas.

<h2> Problem Statement</h2>

Currently in the United States, gun violence is a growing issuse that is endangering the lives of innocent people all across the nation.

<h2> Technical Details </h2>

Our project was built using Node.JS, React, MongoDB, Express.JS, Typescript, SHA256 Hashing, JWT, Twilio, Google Maps API, Google Geolocation API, Microsoft Azure, and Azure Machine learning

For the backend API we utalized Node.js

For the front end we utalized React

We used MongoDB to store phone numbers, acounts, and secure passwords

<h2> Future Improvements </h2>

In the future, we plan to expand our system into schools, restaurants, etc. to help combat gun violence on a greater scale.
