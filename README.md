Bitcamp 2023 surveillance project

Welcome to Project SafeSight. This project was created by Adam Lederer, Matthew Nanas, Rohit Sharma, and Sadou Sow.

<h2> Problem Statement</h2>

Currently in the United States, gun violence is a growing issuse that is endangering the lives of innocent people all across the nation. Shootings are occuring at an all time high, with children being the most impacted. According to the National Institutes of Health, gun violence is now the leading cause of death in children today.

<h2> Solution </h2>

Our project aims to protect those in the event of gun violence by using surveillance cameras to recgonize different types of firearms. Once a firearm is detected, our system will send out alerts via text message to registered users in the surrounding area, providing them with the address, time, and picture of where and when the event is occuring.
