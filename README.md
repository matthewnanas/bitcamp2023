## #Bitcamp2023
Bitcamp 2023 surveillance project

Welcome to ____ (fill in name).

Currently in the United States, shootings are running rampant, endangering the innocent lives of those that live in those areas.

Gun violence has become the leading cause for deaths in children today. (not sure if I should add this)

What if there was a way to combat this and help potentially save the lives of our loved ones. That is where we come in, with our newly created project ___.

_____ is a project created by Matthew Nanas, Adam Lederer, Rohit Sharma, and Sadou Sow, which is able to recgonize different types of firearms using surveillance cameras.
After identifying the firearm, ___ will send out an alert with both a text message and a picture to those within the surrounding area, who registered their number and zipcode on our website.

The major goal with our project is to help shorten response time between the event occuring and getting help on the scene.
